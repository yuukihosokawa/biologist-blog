[Ghostwind Template](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/templates/ghostwind) is a clone of the Casper theme for Ghost created in [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) by [Tailwind Toolbox](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/).


## Using the Template

The template is just a HTML file using a full CDN hosted Tailwind CSS file.

To get the best out of Tailwind CSS, you need to really start customising it.
