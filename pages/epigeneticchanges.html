            <h1>What is genetic and epigenetic regulation?</h1>
            <p>Genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression research has been focused on three molecular mechanisms: histone modifications, DNA methylation, and various RNA-mediated processes. Importantly, advances in understanding the epigenetic processes have provided insight into disease diagnosis and treatment. These epigenetic mechanisms allow the organism to change gene expression in response to external or environmental effects. The primary distinction between genetic and epigenetic regulation is that genetic mechanisms involve the primary DNA sequence in changes or mutations within the sequence whereas epigenetic refers to gene regulation. Furthermore, epigenetics focuses on the regulated events that occur to achieve changes within the cell while genetic regulation is more to do with the processes of chemically modifying genes and using regulatory proteins to do so. A type of epigenetic regulation is DNA methylation, which is defined as the addition of a methyl group to the 5â€²-position of cytosine residues where it is commonly annotated as CpG in mammals. This addition has many effects though, summarized include inhibiting recognition of DNA by proteins and facilitating the binding of proteins to DNA. However, it is frequently associated with gene repression and the CpG pairings are located throughout the genome though are also concentrated within promotor regions of genes more broadly called CpG islands. These CpG islands are believed to have a major role in the control of gene expression as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), enzymes that are responsible for methylation can silence and express genes with addition or removal of methyl groups. For example, transcription factor p53 recruit's enzyme DNMT1 to suppress P21 expression by methylation of the P21 promotor region. Another type of epigenetic regulation includes histone modifications which are characterized by post-translational modifications caused by altering chromatin structure or recruiting histone modifiers. Histones are proteins that tightly pack DNA around 8 histones into a structure called nucleosomes and are commonly modified by methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation. For example, histone acetylation is a key modification indicated by the introduction of an acetyl group to the lysine residues of the histone tail. This activity is mediated by a family of enzymes called histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) that act as co-activators and co-repressors of transcription, respectively. Notably, prostate cancer patients are treated with HDAC inhibitors showing lower levels of prostate-specific antigen because of its activation effect on transcription of P21 protein which affects cell cycle arrest in tumour cells. Lastly, RNA-mediated regulation is described as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that are abundant and have a multitude of functionally important types such as microRNAs, siRNAs, snRNAs, exRNAs, and lncRNAs (Xist and HOTAIR). For example, Xist (X-inactive-specific transcript) is an important major effector of X chromosome inactivation that occurs throughout embryonic development. Altogether, the study of epigenetic alterations and regulation is the basis of gene expression and normal cell function and are of vital information as biomarkers of cancer.</p>
