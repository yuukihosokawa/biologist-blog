            <h1>If I could be a neuron which one would I be?</h1>
            <p>If I were a neuron, I would be a photoreceptor cell because of its specialized function allowing for the phenomena of sight. Photoreceptors cells are found in the retina and are composed of two main types: rods and cones. This kind of neuron has been researched extensively given that it provides an excellent model for understanding the mechanisms for neural progenitors to differentiate. The conversion or transduction of light into nerve signals that is processed into an image is an amazingly complex and highly specific process that primarily takes place in photoreceptor cells. The detection of light stimuli focused onto the retina stimulates photoreceptors, creating an electrical signal that continues to other neurons, the optic nerve and finally to the brain. These cells present a unique polarized morphology that contributes to their function in both dim and bright light conditions. The creation of high-resolution visual images that allow us to see minute details like strands of hair is a testament to the specificity of phototransduction and signal transduction.</p>

            <p>The human retina contains about 120 million rod cells and 6 million cone cells. Both types of photoreceptors have four parts: an outer segment, inner segment, connecting cilium, nuclear region, and synaptic region. The outer segment contains a stack of discs that contain light-sensitive pigments. The shape of the outer segment is the major difference between both types of photoreceptors; rods have a longer, cylindrical outer segment with more discs in contrast to cones that contain shorter, tapering discs within the outer segment. This difference in the outer segment defines the highly light sensitive nature of rods, allowing this cell type to detect a single photon using rhodopsin as a light-sensitive photopigment. However, this higher sensitivity comes at the cost of blurrier vision and without colors. Cone photoreceptors contain a group of light-sensitive proteins called opsins that react to specific wavelengths and thus mediate color perception. These two types of photoreceptors work together in both dim and bright light conditions. </p>
            
            <p>Phototransduction is the process of absorbing light and converting it to an electrical signal. The synaptic region of photoreceptors functions to transfer neurotransmitters such as glutamate to the postsynaptic neurons. Importantly, the activation of photoreceptors does not cause the cellular membrane to depolarize as seen in most sensory systems, instead light activation generates a graded change in membrane potential and rate of transmitter being released. Therefore, stimulus driven processing within phototransduction is mediated by graded potential in contrast to action potentials because of the short distances involved in synaptic transmission. This conversion of light information from the photon into nerve impulses communicable to the nervous system is called signal transduction. Interestingly, photoreceptors are unique in that when stimulated they become hyperpolarized and conversely depolarized when not stimulated. This important distinction can be seen in that the neurotransmitter glutamate is continuously released and stops being released when the cell is not stimulated. This has functional consequences that include amplification of signal as cones require significantly brighter light compared to rods and produces reduced noise in response to stimuli compared to touch and olfaction. </p>
               
            <p>The focus of clinical research has been involved with restoration and regeneration of visual function by transplantation. With the advent of gene therapies, retinal repair is now possible for inherited conditions affecting photopigments and some are even starting clinical trials (Srinivasan and Dubra. Blindness is a condition characterized by the loss of light-sensing photoreceptors, however, Singh and MacLaren reported in 2011 residual retinal circuits can be reawakened after photoreceptor loss and define a goal for stem-cell-based therapy to replace photoreceptors. The real-world application of this research can have a long-lasting positive impact on the quality of life for those that cannot experience the phenomenon of vision. Therefore, I would be most likely a photoreceptor because I share much in common such as being extraordinarily intricate, am prone to dysfunction and degeneration, and have an interestingly applicable future insight for improvement. </p>
               
            <p>Photoreceptors provide an interesting comparison to other elements of the central nervous system regarding information processing and its uniqueness in response to light with sustained graded membrane potential changes. I identify with this type of neuron because I am so dependent on my vision. As it is the most important and complex sense, and it is mirrored in the number of studies that reflect this. As a result, far more of the primate brain is engaged in processing visual information than in processing information from any of the other senses (Pike et al.. The same visual circuitry that evolved from jawed vertebrate gnathostomes that lived 400 million years ago has remarkably remained the same ever since. If I were a neuron, I would without a doubt be a photoreceptor because of its sensitivity to light and ability to view visible light within the electromagnetic spectrum of wavelengths between 300 and 850 nanometers. Lastly, the human visual system is the portal through which we can make wonderful memories, learn new things, and improve the world.</p>
