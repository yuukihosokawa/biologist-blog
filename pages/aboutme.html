            <h1>About Yuuki Hosokawa</h1>
            Hello, my name is <strong>Yuuki Hosokawa</strong> and you have found my about me page! I was born and raised in Connecticut until I traveled across the pond to the UK for university. I am currently on track to graduate from <strong>University of Essex</strong> in the Summer of 2022 with a Bachelors in <strong>Biology</strong>.
            Outside of my work life I am incredibly passionate about photography, working out and planes. One day I hope to be proud of how far I have come and what I've accomplished. I am especially interested in looking for opportunities in the fields of Bioinformatics, Immunology, Molecular and Cellular Biology.
            Lastly, I will leave you with an interesting quote to think about:<blockquote>
                Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell
                    - Edward Abbey
            </blockquote>
