            <h1>Long-term memory is not a single system</h1>
            <p> Long-term memory (LTM) is not a single system but a complex mechanism that allows us to store information for long periods of time. Memory is not stored in a specific brain area; it is distributed within a different set of localized areas. According to Miller et al, the span of immediate memory imposes a severe limitation on the amount of information we can receive, process, and remember. Miller popularized a 'magical' number seven as the limit of short-term memory chunks of information we can store while long-term memory is limitless. In contrast, the Atkinson-Shiffrin 1968 memory model proposed a dual store consolidation of information processing that enters short-term memory and the more it is rehearsed, the more it is strengthened in LTM. Finally, the 1974 Baddeley's memory model proposes a further division or three-component of short-term memory that includes visuospatial sketchpad, episodic buffer, and phonological loop. This model of working memory provides a distinction for synaptic consolidation, evidenced by the fact that information is encoded and transformed from short-term to long-term memory which is reinforced by retrieval or recall. </p>
            <p> Long-term memory does not have a single located brain region or area. Memory storage has for a long time been considered to be localized to the hippocampus, a complex brain structure in the temporal lobe below the cerebral cortex associated with formation of new memories. Interestingly, research has shown that different types of long-term memories are stored in different parts of the brain. However, the hippocampus is the catalyst for LTM just as the occipital cortex can be regarded as the centre for processing visual information. Memories do not have a centralized location but are stored through circuitry as can be seen in people with organ transplants that have reported emotional reactions and feelings that they have never had before. For example, explicit memory is information that can be evoked consciously and after being encoded by the hippocampus is stored in the temporal lobe. This can be demonstrated as damage to the medial temporal lobe is associated with poor explicit memory. The two types of explicit memory include episodic and semantic memory. Episodic refers to events that happen such as marriage, birthday, and a funeral while semantic memory is responsible for storage of factual information like the function of the basal ganglia. The other division of LTM is implicit memories which are related to the skills that a person learns and cannot be recalled consciously such as riding a bike, swimming, or speaking. These factors all contribute to the generalized and believed unlimited capacity for storage of LTM which allows for our conscious existence.</p>
            
            <p> Short and long-term memory have two very distinct differences, the first being the duration and second is the limit in chunk capacity. These fundamental aspects contribute to the complex network that defines information processing and retention. The best example of which can be illustrated in relation to brain damaged individuals who have been studied to explain the formation of new memories. The encoding storage of memories was shown to be stored in different parts of the brain famously examined in H.M., a patient with hippocampal damage. Henry Molaison or H.M. suffered memory loss because of a bilateral medial temporal lobectomy that successfully treated his very severe case of epilepsy, though caused him to become unable to form new memories. This ground-breaking patient study proved that the removal of the hippocampus and temporal lobe causes an inability to consolidate and store information in LTM, a condition called anterograde amnesia. Interestingly, Molaison did retain many functions that included: intelligence and personality, recollection of memory pre-surgery in a graded way, working memory of about 30 seconds, and completely preserved motor skills or a form of spatial/episodic memory. These preserved functions showed that there are different systems for encoding and retrieval of LTM and procedural and declarative memories. Therefore, it can be concluded that motor skill learning, working memory, and lexical memory is not mediated by the medial temporal lobe or hippocampi as they were removed in patient H.M. As seen in H.M. and other brain damaged patients, the activity of retrieval of spatial and declarative memories occurs at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the frontal lobe. The movement of memories from hippocampus to the PFC takes years to complete and hippocampal damage causes recent memories to be destroyed. Thanks to Molaison's contribution to science, the field of neuroscience was revolutionized and it transformed the understanding of organization of human memory.</p>
            
            <p> Another interesting case is an individual K.C. who suffered a serious closed head injury sustained in a motorcycle accident with extensive brain lesions in multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions causing severe amnesia. Similar to H.M., most of K.C.'s cognitive abilities remained intact and healthy, though his ability to develop novel generic information was impaired. This is more generally referred to as episodic memory, which typically involves the ability to learn, store and retrieve information about unique personal experiences that occur in daily life (Dickerson and Eichenbaum. Importantly, the brain damage he suffered caused dysfunction in episodic memory, however, did not impact his semantic memory which included knowledge of mathematics, history, and geography. However, there is a good deal of variability in semantic learning in amnesic patients (Hamann &amp; Squire. Further investigation is needed to clarify the uniqueness of episodic memory and autonoetic consciousness and the role of awareness in reflection or planning for the future in LTM consolidation. </p>
            
            <p> There is ongoing research under the umbrella of cognitive neuroscience that will identify and discover more accurate models of memory consolidation. There is still a lot to understand and designing better experiments or models will expand our understanding of the interactions between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, among others. Recent research has suggested that the hippocampus is only involved with consolidating relational memories for a short time and afterwards the memories are established in the cerebral cortex. An interesting difference for further study could be that real memories require more spread-out retrieval as it is more detailed, and the experiments performed in laboratory settings only provide a small portion of the reality in vivo. Further investigation into the mechanisms for acquisition, consolidation and recall of associations in the brain is necessary for the treatment of numerous debilitating neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, dementia, and amnesia.</p>
